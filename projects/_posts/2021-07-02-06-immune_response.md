We have developed a tool, Polysolver, for genotyping HLA alleles and identifying somatic mutations in tumors. We used mutation data and HLA haplotypes to infer neoantigens across cancer. Predicted neoantigens were used as part of a vaccination trial in melanoma. We also developed tools for analysis of mutations in single-cell data and are applying to tumors and immune cells, including in Multiple Myeloma.

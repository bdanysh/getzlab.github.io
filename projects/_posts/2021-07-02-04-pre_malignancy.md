By studying mutations in normal cells and pre-cancer lesions, we can detect clonal expansions in pre-malignant tissues. We have observed clonal expansions across essentially all normal tissue types. Leveraging the association between mutation density and the epigenetic state of a cell, we study the tissue- and cell-of-origin of all major cancer types enabling better understanding the transition from pre-malignant clones to cancer.

# Credit

Our lab website's design and implementation is indebted to [Trevor Bedford] at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, who created a powerful site generation framework that he has made freely available on [GitHub][1] and which has been employed as the foundation for many other academic sites.  Our site's code base began with a fork of the [Allan Drummond]'s lab [website][2], which was heavily inspired by the Bedford Lab website.   Like both the Bedford and Drummond lab websites, our site is built with [Jekyll Bootstrap], a static site generator, and like the Drummond Lab site, is deployed using [GitHub Pages].

Our site's source code is freely available on [GitHub][4]. All code is placed under the MIT license. You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, we'd appreciate attribution and links back to [getzlab.org], [drummondlab.org] and [bedford.io].
